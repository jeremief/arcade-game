## Description
This project forms part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree.

The purpose is to create a game where the user has reach the top of the game board without being hit by the moving enemies.

The player is moved around by using the arrow keys. Hitting the enemies resets the game. Reaching the last row of the game resets the game and displays the message "You won!"

You can increase the games difficulty by increasing the number of enemies in the game's parameters in the app.js file. The y axis and speed of each enemy is randomised.
